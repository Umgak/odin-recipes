    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lohikeitto is a Finnish salmon chowder, made with potatoes, carrots, and leek!</p>
    <p>It's creamy, hearty, and always delicious!</p>
    <p>This is Lily's favorite recipe, it was given to her by a close friend.</p>

    <h2>Serving suggestions</h2>
    <p>I've experimented with adding a small amount of lemon juice to the finished product with some success. Give it a try!</p>
    <p>Dunking sourdough bread into the broth is delicious.</p>
