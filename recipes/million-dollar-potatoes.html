    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These million dollar twice-baked potatoes are creamy and rich. Potatoes are stuffed with Boursin and Cheddar cheeses, sour cream, cream, butter, bacon and green onions; they are also great to make ahead!</p>
    <p>Recipe shamelessly lifted from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/million-dollar-twice-baked-potatoes-recipe-11816365">Allrecipes</a>. It looked tasty.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 package spreadable gourmet cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced or 3 tablespoons snipped fresh chives</li>
        <li>fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients and preheat oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Scrub potatoes and dry with a clean cloth or paper towel, oil in olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes directly on the oven rack in the center of the oven until fork tender, about 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Allow potatoes to cool long enough to handle. Cut in half and scoop out interior flesh into a large bowl, being careful not to tear the skins. Set skins on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Mash potatoes in the bowl, and stir in cream, gourmet cheese, melted butter, half the shredded cheese, and cream. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use all the potato mixture to stuff the reserved potato skins, mounding up as needed.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375°F until heated through, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with bacon and green onions or chives. Garnish with parsley and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
